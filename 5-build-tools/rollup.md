## rollup

### Highlights

- often only simple setup required
- very extensible with large ecosystem of plugins
- excellent tree-shaking and multiple common chunks
- some wrappers with more advanced features available (e.g. TDSX, microbundle)

### Lowlights

- no integrated dev server
- issues sometimes hard to debug

### Use when:

- you are writing a library
- you know what UMD, ESM and CJS are
