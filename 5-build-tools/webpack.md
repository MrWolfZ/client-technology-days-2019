## Webpack

### Highlights

- many CLI wrappers that make usage mostly simple
- very extensible with large ecosystem of plugins
- used in many popular web frameworks
- dev server is fast and works very well

### Lowlights

- configuration can be huge and complex
- some wrappers abstract too much
- single common chunk can end up huge
- debugging can be tricky

### Use when:

- you are writing a web application
- you want something that often just works out of the box (with wrappers)
- you enjoy writing configuration more than features
- you didn't even know what this is
