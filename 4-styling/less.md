## LESS

### Highlights

- simple pre-processor
- code reads a lot like plain CSS
- variables lead to more DRY code
- variables allow easy theming

### Lowlights

- needs compilation
- limited support for mixins and other programming constructs

### Use when:

- you haven't had time to switch to SASS yet
- you don't want the complexity of yet another programming language in your tech stack
