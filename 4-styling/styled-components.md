## Styled Components

### Highlights

- all the power of JS/TS at your hands
- tree-shaking for your styles
- generated CSS is almost optimal
- integrated theming support
- great testing support for Jest
- encourages separating styling and (business-)logic

### Lowlights

- for optimal runtime performance needs additional build plugin
- limited framework support
- needs IDE plugin for syntax highlighting

### Use when:

- you prefer coding as much as possible in JS/TS
- you are using React
- you are not using TypeScript 3.4.X
- you are very creative in coming up with names for your `div`s
