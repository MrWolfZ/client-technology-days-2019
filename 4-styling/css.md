- no compilation
- great browser tooling

### Lowlights

- need to manually maintain vendor prefixes

- limited variables support

### Use when:

- you are writing a small app with a small team
- you are creating a prototype
- you need full control over the final CSS
- you like repeating yourself
- you like repeating yourself
