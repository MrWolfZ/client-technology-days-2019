## SASS

### Highlights

- fully fledged programming language (e.g. conditionals, loops)
- variables lead to more DRY code
- variables allow easy theming
- mixins are a powerful concept

### Lowlights

- needs compilation
- steep learning curve for advanced features
- two quite different syntaxes that are hard to choose between

### Use when:

- you are working on a non-trivial web app
- your job title says "designer" but you'd rather be a coder
