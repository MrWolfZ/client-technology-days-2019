## React

### Highlights

- library character, i.e. very composable
- excellent development experience & tools (especially with TypeScript/TSX)
- refactoring is a breeze
- strong functional concepts
- good runtime performance
- maintained by a large company with good development process (e.g. RFCs)

### Lowlights

- fragmented ecosystem
- very "techy" way of building apps
- often custom complicated build setup required

### Use when:

- your team consists mainly of coders
- you are building a large composable application
- you need a minimal runtime footprint
- you enjoy spending your weekends sifting through thousands of libraries on Github to find the **best** solution
