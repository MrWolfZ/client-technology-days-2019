## Vue

### Highlights

- managed ecosystem
- excellent runtime performance due to automatic change tracking
- passionate community
- caters to designers as well as developers
- easily configurable build process
- great tooling (e.g. Vue DevTools)

### Lowlights

- component declaration structure takes some getting used to
- doesn't play nicely with TypeScript
- IDE support could be better

### Use when:

- your team has a design focus
- you want a managed ecosystem with excellent performance
- you don't need your IDE to tell you what to do
