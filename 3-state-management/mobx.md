## MobX

### Highlights

- small and simple
- unopinionated
- feels like native JavaScript
- unobtrusive for consumers, it just works

### Lowlights

- seems like black magic at first
- tricky to debug issues
- varying framework support

### Use when:

- you prefer objects over functions
- you don't want a library to define your architecture
- you liked performing magic tricks as a child (or as an adult for that matter)
