## Vuex

### Highlights

- excellent performance due to Vue reactivity integration
- very good documentation
- good integration into Vue DevTools

### Lowlights

- not very type-safe, i.e. lots of strings flying around
- only available in Vue apps

### Use when:

- you are writing a non-trivial Vue app
- you like saying "view eggs"
