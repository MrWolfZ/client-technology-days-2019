## Redux

### Highlights

- excellent tooling (Redux DevTools)
- time-travel debugging
- easily extendable through middlewares
- immutability prevents many race-conditions
- reducers are very simple to test

### Lowlights

- often causes lots of boilerplate
- can be hard to wrap your head around functional concepts
- sometimes tricky to get it right
- varying framework support
- many derivatives that are difficult to choose from

### Use when:

- you prefer functions over objects
- you are not afraid of thunking your way around some obstacles
- you like to fold things
