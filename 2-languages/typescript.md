## TypeScript

### Highlights

- great development experience due to excellent tooling
- catches many mistakes early
- types allow refactoring safely

### Lowlights

- tooling can be unstable on very large code bases
- compilation takes time
- writing types can be quite verbose
- there are sometimes crazy developers in teams that write complex incomprehensible types

### Use when:

- you are working on a big app or with a big team
- your team is used to statically typed languages
- you love seeing lots of colored squiggly lines when writing code to spice up your life
- the first words you spoke to your parents were "type error" when they were trying to feed you something you didn't like
