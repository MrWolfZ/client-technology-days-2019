## JavaScript

### Highlights

- no compilation
- instant reloads
- more succinct code

### Lowlights

- no compilation
- easy to trigger runtime errors
- often there is a pseudo-compilation process anyways, i.e. linting

### Use when:

- you are writing a small app with a small team
- you are creating a prototype
- you love writing tests
- you like driving without a seat belt on
- you feel like throwing up when seeing `A<B<C<D<E>>>>`
